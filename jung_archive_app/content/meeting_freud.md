# Meeting Freud: The Prince and the Father (1907)

*"We met at 1 p.m. and talked virtually without a pause for thirteen hours."* — C.G. Jung

In 1907, a 31-year-old Carl Jung traveled to Vienna to meet the 50-year-old Sigmund Freud. It was the most significant meeting in the history of psychology.

## 1. The Crown Prince

Freud had been isolated by the medical community, treated as a pariah for his theories on sexuality. Jung, working at the prestigious Burghölzli mental hospital in Zurich, was the first "mainstream" psychiatrist to scientifically validate Freud's work (using Association Tests).
*   Freud saw Jung as his "Crown Prince" and "successor"—the Aryan son who would carry Psychoanalysis forward and save it from being labeled a "Jewish science."
*   Jung saw Freud as a father figure—a genius who dared to explore the underworld.

## 2. Examples of the Rift

Despite the 13-hour conversation, cracks appeared almost immediately.
*   **The Mysticism**: Jung asked Freud what he thought of parapsychology. Freud dismissed it as nonsense. Suddenly, a loud *crack* echoed from the bookcase. Jung predicted another crack would happen. *CRACK!* It did. Freud was horrified; Jung was fascinated (Catalytic Exteriorization Phenomenon).
*   **The Sexual Dogma**: Freud begged Jung: *"Promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. This is the essential thing of all. We must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark."*
    *   Jung asked: *"A bulwark against what?"*
    *   Freud replied: *"Against the black tide of mud... of occultism."*

## 3. The Collapse

Jung realized Freud was not seeking truth alone; he was seeking a religion.
*   Freud wanted to reduce everything (God, Art, Dreams) to repressed sexuality.
*   Jung believed the Libido was a general "Life Energy," not just sexual.
*   The conflict was inevitable. The son had to kill the father to find his own soul.

**Summary**: The meeting was a chemical reaction. Two volatile elements mixed, creating an explosion that would divide psychology forever into the Personal (Freud) and the Archetypal (Jung).
