# Mandala: The Circle of the Soul

*"I saw that everything, all paths I had been following, all steps I had taken, were leading back to a single point — namely, to the mid-point. It became increasingly plain to me that the mandala is the centre. It is the exponent of all paths. It is the path to the centre, to individuation."* — C.G. Jung

The **Mandala** (Sanskrit for "Circle") is the central symbol of Jungian psychology. It represents the **Self**—the totality of the personality.
While researching his own unconscious in the *Red Book*, Jung began spontaneously drawing circles every morning. He realized that these drawings were a snapshot of his psychic state.

## 1. Structure of a Mandala

A classic mandala typically has:
*   **The Centre**: The bindu or central point. This is the Self, the God-image within.
*   **The Quaternity**: The number 4. A square or cross. This represents the 4 functions (Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, Intuition) or the 4 cardinal directions. It symbolizes earth/reality/structure.
*   **The Circle**: The container. It represents wholeness, protection, and the "Temenos" (sacred space).

When the psyche is in chaos (neurosis/psychosis), the mandala brings order. It is a "psychic dam" that contains the energy.

## 2. Magic Circle (Temenos)

In alchemy and magic, the circle is drawn to protect the magician from demons.
Psychologically, the Mandala acts as a **Protective Circle**.
*   It prevents the psyche from "leaking out" (dissociation).
*   It prevents the collective unconscious from flooding in (psychosis).
Jung observed that schizophrenic patients often drew mandalas to try to hold their fragmented world together.

## 3. Squaring the Circle

The alchemical problem of the *Quadratura Circuli* (Squaring the Circle) is the attempt to turn the Circle (Spirit/Heaven/3) into the Square (Matter/Earth/4).
*   The Mandala is the union of opposites.
*   It unites the jagged, messy reality of life (Square) with the perfect, eternal wholeness of the soul (Circle).

## 4. How to Practice (Drawing Mandalas)

Jung did not teach "copying" Tibetan mandalas. He taught *spontaneous* generation.
1.  **Draw a Circle**: Use a compass or a plate.
2.  **Start from the Center**: Or the outside. Let the hand move freely.
3.  **Use Color**: Feelings are colors.
4.  **Observe Symmetry**: Is it balanced? Or is it lopsided?
    *   *Lopsided*: Indicates a psychic imbalance.
    *   *Perfect Center*: Indicates a moment of "centering" or peace.
5.  **Do not judge**: It is not art. It is a psychological record.

## 5. The Mandala in the Red Book

Jung's *Red Book* is filled with exquisite mandalas.
*   **System Munditotius**: The first mandala he painted (1916). It maps the entire cosmology (Abraxas, Pleroma).
*   **The Window on Eternity**: A mandala showing the Self as a star in space.

Jung continued to paint mandalas until the end of his life. He considered them the most sensitive indicator of his inner development.

> "The mandala is an archetype of order which appears in times of psychic disorientation or re-orientation."

**Summary**: The Mandala is the visible form of the Self. To draw one is to try to put the chaos of life into a divine order.
