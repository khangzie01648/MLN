# CÁCH LOẠI TÂM LÝ: LA BÀN CỦA TÂM HỒN

*"Sensation tells you that something exists; thinking tells you what it is; feeling tells you whether it is agreeable or not; and intuition tells you whence it comes and where it is going."* — C.G. Jung

In 1921, Jung published *Psychological Types*, creating the foundation for the MBTI and modern personality theory. But Jung's intention was not to label people for corporate HR; it was to understand the *biases* of consciousness.
He realized that every neurosis and every conflict (even his feud with Freud) stemmed from a clash of different "types" of perceiving reality.

## 1. The Two Attitudes: Introversion & Extraversion

This is the flow of psychic energy (Libido).
*   **Extraversion**: Energy flows *outward* to the object. The subject is oriented by external data, social norms, and objective facts. They adapt easily but can lose themselves.
*   **Introversion**: Energy flows *inward* to the subject. The subject is oriented by inner reactions, subjective factors, and archetypes. They are deep but can become isolated.

> "There is no such thing as a pure introvert or extrovert. Such a person would be in the lunatic asylum." — Jung

## 2. The Four Functions

The psyche orients itself using four distinct tools.
*   **Rational (Judging) Functions**:
    *   **Thinking (T)**: Interpretive. Uses logic, cause-and-effect, and definitions. "True or False."
    *   **Feeling (F)**: Evaluative. Uses values, emotional tone, and acceptance/rejection. "Good or Bad" (not just 'emotion', but 'value').
*   **Irrational (Perceiving) Functions**:
    *   **Sensation (S)**: Perception via the senses. Reality as it is. Focus is on facts, details, the "Now."
    *   **Intuition (N)**: Perception via the unconscious. Possibilities, patterns, the "Future." Focus is on the hidden potential.

## 3. The Cross of Functions (The Superior & Inferior)

We cannot be good at everything. We specialize.
*   **Superior Function**: The tool we use most (e.g., Thinking). It is conscious, differentiated, and reliable.
*   **Inferior Function**: The opposite tool (e.g., Feeling). It is repressed, unconscious, primitive, and "archaic."

**The Law of Opposites**:
*   If you are a *Thinking* type, your *Feeling* is inferior (and possibly touchy or explosive).
*   If you are an *Intuitive* type, your *Sensation* is inferior (you might forget to eat or trip over rugs).

The goal of Individuation is not to be perfect, but to integrate the Inferior function—to bring it out of the darkness.

## 4. The Eight Types

By combining the 2 Attitudes and 4 Functions, we get 8 Types:

1.  **Extraverted Thinking (ET)**: Scientists, lawyers, organizers. Driven by objective facts and laws. (Freud?).
2.  **Introverted Thinking (IT)**: Philosophers, theoretical physicists. Driven by inner ideas. (Kant, Jung?).
3.  **Extraverted Feeling (EF)**: Hostesses, politicians, social glue. Driven by social harmony and shared values.
4.  **Introverted Feeling (IF)**: Poets, monks. "Still waters run deep." Intense inner passion, outwardly cold/reserved.
5.  **Extraverted Sensation (ES)**: Realists, connoisseurs, athletes. Masters of the physical world.
6.  **Introverted Sensation (IS)**: Impressionists, aesthetes. The subjective reaction to the sensory stimulus is key.
7.  **Extraverted Intuition (EN)**: Entrepreneurs, PR agents, adventurers. Always chasing the new possibility.
8.  **Introverted Intuition (IN)**: Prophets, shamans, visionaries. Seeing the archetypes behind reality. (Nietzsche, Cassandra).

## 5. The Transcendent Function

When the Superior and Inferior collide, tension arises.
The solution is not to choose one, but to hold the tension until a "Third" thing arises—a symbol that unites logic and emotion, fact and vision. This is the **Transcendent Function**, the engine of psychological growth.
