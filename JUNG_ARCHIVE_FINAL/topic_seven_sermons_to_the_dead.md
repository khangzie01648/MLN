# The Seven Sermons to the Dead (Septem Sermones ad Mortuos)

*"The dead came back from Jerusalem, where they found not what they sought. They prayed me let them in and besought my word, and thus I began my teaching."* — Sermo I

**The Seven Sermons to the Dead** is the only part of the *Red Book* that C.G. Jung published during his lifetime (anonymously and privately). Written in 1916, it is a Gnostic cosmogony attributed to the ancient Gnostic teacher **Basilides** in Alexandria. It remains the most cryptic, poetic, and essential text for understanding Jung's theological psychology.

In these seven sermons, Jung addresses the "Dead"—which represent the voices of the unpaid ancestors, the unresolved complexes of the collective unconscious, and the spiritual confusion of the modern Western soul.

## Sermo I: The Pleroma and the Void

The first sermon begins with the concept of the **Pleroma** (The Fullness/The Void).

*   **Hyle (Matter)** vs **Pleroma (Spirit)**.
*   The Pleroma is both nothing and everything. It possesses no qualities because it has *all* qualities balanced perfectly.
*   **Creatura** (Created Being) is distinct from Pleroma because it possesses *distinctiveness* (Principium Individuationis). To be alive is to distinguish oneself; to cease distinguishing is to dissolve back into the Pleroma (Death).

> "We are the Pleroma itself, for we are a part of the eternal and the infinite. But we have no share therein, as we are infinitely removed from the Pleroma; not spatially or temporally, but essentially."

## Sermo II: Helios and the Devil

Here Jung introduces the idea that God (Helios) and the Devil are two manifestations of the same Pleroma.
*   **Helios**: The effective god, the source of light.
*   **The Devil**: The source of emptiness.
But above both, there is a god about whom men know nothing, for men forgot him.

## Sermo III: Abraxas

This is the most famous and shocking revelation. Jung resurrects the ancient Gnostic deity **Abraxas**.

> "There is a God about whom you know nothing, because men have forgotten him. We call him by his name: **ABRAXAS**. He is more indefinite still than God and Devil... He is force, duration, change."

Abraxas is the God who unites opposites. He is the wedding of:
*   Good and Evil
*   Light and Dark
*   Life and Death
*   Order and Chaos

In orthodox Christianity, God is Summum Bonum (Highest Good). In Jung's Gnosticism, the true "Terrible God" is Abraxas, who encompasses the fullness of reality, including the horror of existence.

## Sermo IV: The Burning Bush and the Tree

Jung distinguishes between two paths or gods of life:
1.  **The Burning Bush**: The masculine, erotic, burning, consuming spirituality.
2.  **The Tree of Life**: The feminine, growing, accumulating, slow spirituality.

The Dead are taught not to worship just one, but to recognize the powers of growth and consumption.

## Sermo V: Church and Community

A critique of institutional religion ("Church") versus the true spiritual community. Jung argues that community is necessary for weaker souls, but the individual must find their own solitary path to the Self.

> "The community is depth. But solitude is height... The community gives us warmth, solitude gives us light."

## Sermo VI: Sexuality and Spirituality

Jung links Sexuality (The Serpent) and Spirituality (The Dove) as equal daemons.
*   The Serpent desires the earth, the depths, and connection.
*   The Dove desires the heights, the spirit, and separation.
Both must be honored, or one will devour the soul.

## Sermo VII: The Star (The Self)

The final sermon points to the ultimate goal of human existence: becoming one's own Star. This is the **Individuated Self**.

> "Man is a gateway, through which from the outer world of gods, daemons, and souls ye pass into the inner world; out of the greater into the smaller world."
> "At an immeasurable distance stands one single Star in the zenith... This is the God of this one man."

The Star is the individual's unique guiding light, their destiny, their Self. It is distinct from the Pleroma and Abraxas—it is the personal God residing in the psyche.

## Psychological Significance

The *Seven Sermons* is the seed from which all of Jung's later theories grew:
1.  **Individuation**: Differentiation from the unconscious (Pleroma).
2.  **The Shadow**: Accepting the dark side (Abraxas).
3.  **The Self**: The Star at the zenith.
4.  **Opposites**: The core dynamic of psychic energy.

To read the Sermons is to watch Jung actively wrestling with the Collective Unconscious, forging the tools he would later use to heal the modern soul.
