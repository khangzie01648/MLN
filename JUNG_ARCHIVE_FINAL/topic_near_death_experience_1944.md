# C.G. Jung's Near-Death Experience (1944): The Wedding of the Soul

*"It is impossible to convey the beauty and intensity of emotion during those visions. They were the most tremendous things I have ever experienced."* — C.G. Jung, *Memories, Dreams, Reflections*

In early 1944, at the age of 68, Carl Jung suffered a severe heart attack (myocardial infarction) and broke his foot. Hospitalized in a critical state, hung between life and death, he underwent a series of delirious visions that would profoundly alter his understanding of existence, the Self, and the nature of conscious continuity after death.

This event is not merely a biographical footnote; it marks the final "initiation" of Jung, transforming him from the explorer of the Unconscious into the Sage of Küsnacht. It was after this return that he wrote his most hermetic and profound works, including *Aion* and *Mysterium Coniunctionis*.

## 1. The View from the Orbit

Jung found himself floating high above the Earth, gaining a perspective that wouldn't be physically witnessed by humanity until the space age decades later.

> "It seemed to me that I was high up in space. Far below I saw the globe of the earth, bathed in a gloriously blue light. I saw the deep blue sea and the continents... I knew that I was on the point of departing from the earth."

He calculated his altitude to be approximately 1,000 miles. He saw the Arabian desert, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean. The accuracy of his description—long before satellite imagery—remains a topic of fascination. But more important than the geography was the psychological state: a shedding of all earthly attachments.

## 2. The Temple of Pomegranates

Turning away from the Earth, Jung encountered a colossal block of stone floating in space, like a meteorite. Inside, he saw a temple hollowed out.

> "To the right of the entrance, a black Hindu sat silently in lotus posture... He wore a white gown, and I knew that he expected me."

Entering the inner chamber, Jung experienced what he called the **Coniunctio**—the mystic marriage. He did not witness figures of gods or saints, but rather experienced a state of "Objective Cognition."

### The Shedding of the Persona
Jung describes a painful yet ecstatic process of being stripped of everything that made him "Carl Jung"—his history, his achievements, his ego, his desires.

> "I had the feeling that everything was being sloughed away; everything I aimed at or wished for or thought, the whole phantasmagoria of earthly existence, fell away or was stripped from me—an extremely painful process."

What remained was the **Essential Being** (Wesen). He realized that his life was a historical fragment of a larger, timeless mosaic.

## 3. The Refusal to Return

Just as he was about to enter the temple's sanctuary and likely cross the final threshold into death, a vision interrupted him. He saw the image of his doctor, **Dr. Hammerlin**, floating upwards in primal form (the *Basileus of Kos*).

The doctor communicated telepathically that there was a protest against Jung's departure. He was not allowed to leave yet. He had to return to his "box system" (the body and earthly life).

> "I was profoundly disappointed... Life and the whole world struck me as a prison... I had been so glad to shed the burden."

## 4. The Aftermath: A World Enchanted

For weeks after waking, Jung lived in a strange dual-consciousness. By day he was in the hospital; by night he floated in a "blissful universe." He mentioned that during this period, he understood the mathematical structure of history and the cosmos.

> "Night after night I floated in a state of purest bliss, 'thronged round with images of all creation.'"

### The Impact on His Work
This NDE radicalized Jung. He ceased caring about academic approval or scientific respectability. He felt he had seen the truth directly (Gnosis) and no longer needed to hypothesize.
*   **Synchronicity**: His interest in acausal connections deepened.
*   **Alchemy**: He realized the alchemical *Lapis* was not just a metaphor but a reality of the psyche's indestructibility.
*   **Unus Mundus**: The vision of the unitary world became the bedrock of his late philosophy.

## Summary

The 1944 NDE was the moment Jung truly "individuated" in the ultimate sense—transcending the Ego completely to touch the Self. He returned with a message that life is a "short interlude" in a much vaster reality of the Pleroma.
