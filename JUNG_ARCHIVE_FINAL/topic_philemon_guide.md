# Philemon & Elijah: Guides of the Soul

*"Philemon was a pagan and brought with him an Egypto-Hellenistic atmosphere with a Gnostic coloration... He represented a force which was not myself."* — C.G. Jung, *Memories, Dreams, Reflections*

In the visionary descent recorded in the *Red Book* (Liber Novus), Jung did not travel alone. He encountered figures that acted as guides, teachers, and sometimes adversaries. The most prominent among them were **Elijah** and **Philemon**.

These were not merely "imaginary friends" but autonomous personalities of the collective unconscious—archetypes clothed in personal form.

## 1. The Encounter with Elijah and Salome

Jung's first major guide was the biblical prophet **Elijah**.
*   **Appearance**: An old man with a white beard.
*   **Companion**: He was accompanied by a blind young woman named **Salome**.
*   **Symbolism**:
    *   **Elijah** represents **Logos** (Reason, Forethought, Spirit).
    *   **Salome** represents **Eros** (Feeling, Sensation, Pleasure).
    *   The fact that Salome was blind symbolized that Jung's "Feeling function" was unconscious/undeveloped at that time, while his Spirit (Elijah) was clear.
    *   A black serpent also accompanied them, symbolizing the earthly, instinctual wisdom.

Jung was shocked. "Elijah and Salome? But they are from different eras!"
Elijah replied that in the underworld, time does not exist.

## 2. The Transformation into Philemon

As the visions deepened, Elijah faded and a new figure emerged: **Philemon**.
*   **Appearance**: An old man with the horns of a bull and the wings of a kingfisher (a bird). He held a bunch of four keys.
*   **Nature**: Philemon was a "Guru" figure. He was pagan, gnostic, and far more sophisticated than the biblical Elijah. He taught Jung that "Thoughts are objective."
    *   *Thought-lesson*: Jung believed he created his thoughts. Philemon taught him that thoughts are like animals in a forest; they exist independently, and we merely "catch" them.

> "Philemon and other figures of my fantasies brought home to me the crucial insight that there are things in the psyche which I do not produce, but which produce themselves and have their own life."

## 3. The Magician Archetype

Philemon represents the **Wise Old Man** archetype (or the Magician/Mana-Personality).
*   **Role**: To guide the Ego through the chaos of the unconscious.
*   **Danger**: The Ego can become "inflated" by identifying with the Wise Old Man (believing oneself to be a prophet). Jung had to brutally separate his own personality "Carl" from the figure "Philemon" to keep his sanity.
*   **Reality**: Jung walked in his garden in Küsnacht and conversed with Philemon as if he were a real person walking beside him.

## 4. Ka (The Soul)

Later, a third figure appeared: **Ka** (an Egyptian concept of the soul-double).
*   Philemon was the spiritual aspect.
*   Ka was the earth/matter aspect.
*   Jung had to balance the two.

## 5. The Legacy of Philemon

Philemon became the "spirit father" of Jung's psychology.
*   **The Seven Sermons to the Dead**: Jung attributed this text to Basilides, but the voice was Philemon's.
*   **The Inner Guru**: Philemon proved to Jung that the psyche has a superior intelligence center *outside* the Ego. This led to the concept of **The Self**.

In his tower at Bollingen, Jung carved the face of Philemon into the stone wall, honoring the spirit that guided him through the night.

**Key Insight**: We all have a "Philemon"—an inner center of wisdom that knows more than we do. The goal of active imagination is to find him and learn to listen.
